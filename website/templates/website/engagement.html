            <h2>Alexander Patrick Bailey<br></h2>
            <p>Alex is a native Georgian (we hear that's rare) that grew up and lives in the Woodstock area.  He currently works on automation software and web design for the Access Management team at AT&T.  Melissa might tell you that she is the lucky one in the relationship but, Alex will be very quick to assure you that is not the case.  He knows he has truly found his better half in every sense of the phrase.  Alex enjoys spending his days tinkering in the garage, boating, polishing up his truck, and most of all following Melissa around on her many adventures.  He can't wait to call the most beautiful, inspiring and brilliant woman in the world his wife.</p>

            <h2>Melissa Marie Manson<br></h2>
            <p>Melissa graduated in the summer of 2015 from the University of Georgia with degrees in Advertising and Theatre. She currently works as a Sales Executive at A Closer Look Mystery Shopping in Norcross, Georgia. When she isn’t working, adventuring with Alex, or acting as loving cat mom to her fur babies Yoda and Tang, you will likely find her crafting, thrift store shopping, watching Disney movies, or volunteering with the Alumnae Advisory Committee of Pi Beta Phi at UGA. She never dreamed she would meet a man as generous, intelligent, and kind as Alex (who is also remarkably tolerant of the trail of glitter that seems to follow her around). Melissa is counting down the days until she can steal the name of the man that stole her heart and can’t wait to begin her forever as Mrs. Alexander Bailey.</p>

            <p>When Melissa first saw Alex on Tinder, she thought for sure he was a catfish...or a player. She couldn’t imagine how someone so witty and handsome could be single. It was love at first (right) swipe. The conversation began with a discussion of which Nintendo 64 game was best and evolved into an exchange of Taylor Swift gifs. While Melissa was certain she had met, “the one,” her busy schedule meant she had to keep her soulmate waiting for two weeks before they could have their first date. On February 11, 2017, Alex and Melissa shared their last first date. While Melissa didn’t typically allow suitors to drive her on the first date, Alex had picked a classy restaurant only 0.8 miles from her apartment (and she wore her best running boots...just in case). What Alex didn’t divulge to Melissa was how he had come about the reservation to JCT Kitchen that fateful evening. When Alex attempted to secure a reservation, he was told it was the Saturday before Valentine’s Day, and no reservations were available. Alex requested to speak to a manager. During the call, he explained the date was the first with someone who would be very special to him. No doubt inspired by the beautiful love story that was to be, the manager accommodated his request. Melissa and Alex dined together at JCT Kitchen and continued the fun at Ormsbys, a nearby speakeasy. After Melissa beat Alex multiple times at Skee-Ball, they shared their first kiss in front of the Skee-Ball table.</p>

            <p>During their courtship, Alex and Melissa frequently attended performances at The Fabulous Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia. It became a tradition that after each show, the lovebirds would cross the street to take a photo together with the marquee sign behind them. On June 3, 2018, Alex took Melissa on one last “hurrah” before they would need to start saving up for the expenses of adulthood. He asked, “Is Hamilton a good show?” and Melissa nearly fainted at the prospect of attending the hit Broadway show during its nationwide tour. Alex encouraged Melissa to go all-out, getting her hair, makeup, and nails done. Despite their tickets being for a matinee, Alex convinced Melissa to wear an evening gown to the performance. He reasoned they wouldn’t be taking any vacations for the next year, so they might as well have something fun to remember. At this point, Melissa began to suspect something might be up. She knew Alex wouldn’t ask her to marry him if he had not asked her mother. Unfortunately for Melissa, Diane claimed Alex had not approached her. Ever the realist, Diane told Melissa to not get her hopes up and to just enjoy the day. Secretly, Alex had indeed asked for her permission, which she happily granted. The day of, Alex hid the ring box in the pocket furthest from Melissa. After the show, Alex asked Melissa if she wanted to take their photo across the street. Melissa agreed, and they held hands as they crossed the street. Melissa nearly broke Alex’s hand as they were crossing when she spotted the Marquee reading, “Melissa, Will You Marry Me?” After safely crossing the street (after Melissa had already started crying), Alex got down on one knee and asked Melissa to marry him. It was the easiest (and quickest) answer Melissa ever gave...YES!</p>
